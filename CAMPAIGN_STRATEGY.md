*   **Overlay Text**: "Flat vs. Real"

### Asset 2: The "Speedrun" (Video)
*   **Action**: Screen recording of dragging a logo onto the canvas -> Clicking Generate -> Result appears in 5 seconds.
*   **Caption**: "From design to Etsy listing in 10 seconds."

### Asset 3: The "Zoom In" (Static Image)
