## 1. General Questions

**Q: What is Copié-Collé?**
A: Copié-Collé is an AI tool that lets you place your logo or design onto real product photos (like hoodies, mugs, and caps) without using Photoshop. It automatically handles lighting, shadows, and fabric wrinkles to make it look 100% real.

**Q: Is it free?**
A: We have a hybrid model:
- **Free Tryout**: You can try specific "Free" products without paying.
- **Pay-as-you-go**: Buy credit packs (starting at $4.99) to generate high-res mockups.
- **Pro Membership**: $9.99/mo for unlimited generations and 4K downloads.

**Q: How do I remove the watermark?**
A: Watermarks are automatically removed when you:
1. Use a "Free" product.
2. Spend credits to generate a paid product.
3. Have an active Pro Membership.

## 2. Troubleshooting

**Q: My generation failed / "Something went wrong".**
A: This can happen if:
- The uploaded logo is too large (try keeping it under 5MB).
- The AI service is temporarily busy.
- **Solution**: Refresh the page and try again. If you lost credits, contact support with your email, and we will refund them.

**Q: The logo looks distorted or weird.**
A: The AI tries to wrap the logo around the product's curves.
- **Fix**: Try resizing your logo in the editor (make it slightly smaller) or rotating it to align better with the product's surface.

**Q: I paid but didn't get my credits.**
A: Credits are usually added instantly.
- **Check**: Log out and log back in.
- **Still nothing?**: Send us your transaction ID or the email you used for payment.

## 3. Account & Billing

**Q: How do I cancel my subscription?**
A: You can cancel anytime via the Lemon Squeezy customer portal. The link is in your email receipt, or you can find it on your Dashboard under "Manage Subscription".

**Q: Do credits expire?**
A: No, purchased credit packs never expire. Monthly bonus credits (for Pro members) roll over as long as your subscription is active.

## 4. For Etsy Sellers

**Q: Can I use these images on Etsy?**
A: Yes! You have a full commercial license for any image you generate. You can use them on Etsy, Shopify, Instagram, or your own website.

**Q: How do I get the "Etsy Access Code"?**
A: If you bought a specific template on our Etsy shop, the access code is in the PDF receipt you downloaded from Etsy. Enter that code on the product page to unlock it forever.

**Q: Can I upload my own product photos?**
A: Not yet, but we are building a "Custom Mockup" feature for Pro users. Stay tuned!
